Among Bollywood's Best.

What to say of this 'almost perfect Bollywood movie' and arguably among the greatest from the industry, it had absolutely everything in it, a blend of all the facets of Hindi cinema, yet modelled on the Western movies running in Hollywood at that time and before. No need to elaborate on any of the elements of this film, as any Hindi movie lover would know; but to mention just one, I would talk of the action sequences in the running train which were such perfectly shot that they seemed way ahead of its time. It had a slow opening in the theatres but gathered steam in the second week and o boy, it never looked back from there. I still remember it running as late as the 90s in some theatre or the other in the city and had a release every year whenever they found a slot for this classic. If the number of times a movie been watched by any viewer is the question, it would perhaps make the Guinness Books by now.
15th August 1975. The day Ramesh Sippy's magnum opus Sholay released at the Minerva cinema, Mumbai. 

Undoubtedly, this film doesn't need a review. We all know Sholay and we all love Sholay. It is a benchmark in Indian cinema and each one of us has his own story to tell about the classic. From seeing it more than 50 times to purchasing ticket in black for an obscene amount or memorising every dialogue, personal stories around the legendary film abound. 

I first experienced the Sholay phenomenon in the year 1985 during Diwali time when I visited my paternal grandparents place at Mahim. The society had hired a huge screen and projector to film it in its premise. The euphoria at the time of screening with loud ceetes and people mouthing dialogues along with the characters and dancing during the songs is a moment I will never forget ever. 

I have seen the movie multiple times later on VHS (during video cassette era) and on DVD. It is a regular on satellite channels also where I still catch it whenever possible. 
One of the best films of 1970s. Dharam and Amit were no doubt impressive but Sanjeev impressed everyone with his exceptional acting talent.This Sholay movie was loved to see by my whole Family members.
A master class with master performers in Dharamendra, Amitabh, Hema and Jaya. Of course two of the greatest performers in Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan. Equally supported by super taleted Asrani , Jagadeep, Keshto Mukherjee and AK Hangal. Paisa wasool movie.
What to write about this movie wherein an actor who didn't utter a single word have become celebrity overnight. In my opinion no one could have performed the role of Gabbar Singh better than Amjad Khan.what to say everyone has left a mark rather telling performance in the movie. Dialogues were just superb & are being used in daily life also.
THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE IN INDIA.
Best movie ever. Even Hollywood action movies lagging behind sholay. The best camera angles, the instantaneous sound track before action, all good qualities cooked up in one drama. The movie is close to reality. It is possible for two people having natural combat techniques to finish a gang single handedly. Marvelous. Today movie directors, with all the scientific cameras and digitalization still cannot compete this movie. I suggest today s movie makers to first read a lot and than think a lot than you will ever ever be able to make a movie like sholay.
Excellent Movie. Full of Action,songs, commedy good story and Director was excellent. The most excellent character in movie is Gabbar. Amzad khan has made excellent acting, because of which the picture is still popular and was runing for about 10 years in Minerva theatre. The intresting part of the movie is that villan has attracted audience. It is very difficult to act as strong villan character. Amjad khan was the best. Beside that Dharmendra,Amitabh,Hema malini and sanjeev kumar acting was superb. But Amjad was more powerfull of all. I have not seen such villan character even after till now. Hats off to story writer,producer,Director and all actors in this movie.
Super hit movie. In this movie songs are amazing and whole cast and crew are also amazing.... It is full of adventures, drama, action and little bit of emotion... The best part of this moive is that dialogues of Jay and verru  they both are legendary actors in the filmy Industry...  And gorgeous hema malini as a basanti.. No words to say about her acting..  Just amazing.. She is one of my favourite actor...

Evergreen Film, that's what Sholay is. After 45 yrs also, the movie is so relatable in today's day . Music, cinematography, direction, acting, music, action sequences, needless to mention the iconic dialogues.... all par excellence. I think, till date,the best movie of Hindi film industry. A break of a couple of months, guess one is ready again to watch Sholay.üëçüëçüôèüôè
THE GREATEST INDIAN FILM OF ALL TIME. STARRING GREAT AMITABH BACCHAN AS JAI AND DHARMENDRA AS VIRU . AND FEMALE CHARECTER SA GREAT HEMA MALINI AS BASANTI AND JAYA BACCHAN AS RADHA. AND SANJEEV KAPOOR AS THAKUR AND A DANGEROUS VILLAIN AS GABBAR SINGH AS AMJAD KHAN. MAKES IT A MUST WATCH FILM . THE ACTION IS ALSO AMAZING AND LASTLY THE VENUE OF SHOOTING IS ALSO AMAZING IT WAS SHOOTEN ON BENGALIRU GREAT HILLS OF BENGALURU.
Fabulous movie never see in whole life. Great performances by big b and dharmendra.  Sanjeev Kumar acts so well.  And most important the basanti That is gorgeous hema malini.  I like her style of acting.  And the gabbar  is fab.  The dialogue of this film  l will never forget kitne aadmi the!!!  And this movie is about the friendship of two friends like dharmendra ji and big b!!!üòòüòòüòò
All time favourite movie. The barren Ramdevaberta was  made into a such a nice set of Ramgarh owing to the tedious labour of the technicians and of course Ramesh Sippy ji that it has become a must-visit spot for the movie lovers. I have personally visited that place and thanked Ramesh Sippy ji for his tireless efforts

Sholay has a very beautiful plot. I like the way hema malini dances to the music jab tak hai jaan main naauchunge. 
In the movie , when hema malini romances with dharmendra and learns pistol shooting is delight to watch. 

I have seen the movie twice , in school days and after doing MBA.
Best film of Bollywood..Amitabh bacchan and every cast is excellent..
Gabbar singh really create history of Villan..Music, Story , direction, dialogues..every thing is perfect..and superb.

This is the film which can seen multiple time..and you feel fresh as it watch first time..this is the main reason behind sholay..
Sholay its not a movie.  Its reality in every sense.  Feels blessed to have seen this movie.  Sholay a movie of life time.  All characters in this movie can be related to ones lifetime.  Will always remain thankful to all those was connected directly or indirectly in makng of this epic.
