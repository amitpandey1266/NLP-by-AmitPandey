      " [\"Among Bollywood's Best.\", \"What to say of this 'almost perfect Bollywood movie' and arguably among the greatest from the industry, it had absolutely everything in it, a blend of all the facets of Hindi cinema, yet modelled on the Western movies running in Hollywood at that time and before. No need to elaborate on any of the elements of this film, as any Hindi movie lover would know; but to mention just one, I would talk of the action sequences in the running train which were such perfectly shot that they seemed way ahead of its time. It had a slow opening in the theatres but gathered steam in the second week and o boy, it never looked back from there. I still remember it running as late as the 90s in some theatre or the other in the city and had a release every year whenever they found a slot for this classic. If the number of times a movie been watched by any viewer is the question, it would perhaps make the Guinness Books by now.\", \"15th August 1975. The day Ramesh Sippy's magnum opus Sholay released at the Minerva cinema, Mumbai.\", \"Undoubtedly, this film doesn't need a review. We all know Sholay and we all love Sholay. It is a benchmark in Indian cinema and each one of us has his own story to tell about the classic. From seeing it more than 50 times to purchasing ticket in black for an obscene amount or memorising every dialogue, personal stories around the legendary film abound.\", 'I first experienced the Sholay phenomenon in the year 1985 during Diwali time when I visited my paternal grandparents place at Mahim. The society had hired a huge screen and projector to film it in its premise. The euphoria at the time of screening with loud ceetes and people mouthing dialogues along with the characters and dancing during the songs is a moment I will never forget ever.', 'I have seen the movie multiple times later on VHS (during video cassette era) and on DVD. It is a regular on satellite channels also where I still catch it whenever possible.', 'One of the best films of 1970s. Dharam and Amit were no doubt impressive but Sanjeev impressed everyone with his exceptional acting talent.This Sholay movie was loved to see by my whole Family members.', 'A master class with master performers in Dharamendra, Amitabh, Hema and Jaya. Of course two of the greatest performers in Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan. Equally supported by super taleted Asrani , Jagadeep, Keshto Mukherjee and AK Hangal. Paisa wasool movie.', \"What to write about this movie wherein an actor who didn't utter a single word have become celebrity overnight. In my opinion no one could have performed the role of Gabbar Singh better than Amjad Khan.what to say everyone has left a mark rather telling performance in the movie. Dialogues were just superb & are being used in daily life also.\", 'THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE IN INDIA.']\n"
